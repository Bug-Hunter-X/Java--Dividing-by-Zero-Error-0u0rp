# Java: Dividing by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Java: division by zero.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to divide by a variable initialized to zero. This results in an `ArithmeticException` being thrown.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles potential division by zero errors.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile `bug.java` (this will result in a runtime exception).
3. Compile and run `bugSolution.java` (this will execute without errors).
